Version: who gives a shit

Auto 'Beer-Brooch' module for Tera Proxy

If you find any bug, don't let me know.

**Command module required to run this**

## Done
 * Uses Root Beer and Brooch right after you use buff skills
 * Supported skills:
    * Deadly Gamble
    * Mana Boost
    * Shadow Reaping
    * Ragnarok
    * Unleash
    * Adrenaline Rush
    * Can add/remove in 'skills.js' file
 * Make sure you have more than 2 beers in your inventory, if you have 1 beer, it won't work.
 * Can look in 'index.js' file to change:
    * Notifications in game
    * Delay to use beer after buff skill

## Commands
**/8 to open proxy chat**
```
/8 letmedrink (Toggle the module on/off)
/8 getskillinfo (see below)
```

## Recent updates
 * Support for Unleash, I don't know the other buffing skills, use getskillinfo and fix them in skills.js (See below)


## How to get new skills information
 * Use the 'getskillinfo' command
 * See if it show the message: 'Use the desired skill and check proxy console.'
 * Use any skill you want in-game
 * See proxy console to get your infos
